Schema Conversion
-----------------

This is how you convert domesday.schema (in ASN.1 format) to domesday-schema.ldif (in LDIF format) for importation into slapd.

You don't need to do this as part of a normal installation; you only need to 
do it if you change the schema.

Create a temp directory:

    mkdir /tmp/ldif_output

Convert the schema (yes, schema_convert.conf needs those other schema in it as well as the one you are converting)
    slaptest -f schema_convert.conf -F /tmp/ldif_output

Make the following changes to "/tmp/ldif_output/cn=config/cn=schema/cn={NNNN}domesday.ldif":

    1) change dn to:
       dn: cn=domesday,cn=schema,cn=config
    2) remove bits matching {\d+}
    3) remove the last few lines (from structuralObjectClass on down)

Add it to the directory:

   sudo ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f "/tmp/ldif_output/cn=config/cn=schema/cn={NNNN}domesday.ldif"
