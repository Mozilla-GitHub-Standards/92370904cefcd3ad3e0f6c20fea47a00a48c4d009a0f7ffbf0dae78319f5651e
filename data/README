This directory contains data and scripts to generate test files for
directory servers.

generate.pl	Script to generate lists of names in plain or LDIF form.
		usage:
		./generate.pl [-P] [number] [Org DN] [mail domain]

		-P causes Posix account information to be generated

given-names	Input data for generate.pl
surnames

names.ldif	Sample generated LDIF file

names		List of the names found in the LDIF file (NOTE: not all unique)

The generated names should have statistical properties similar to those
found in an academic/research environment in the UK.  The source data
is currently 7-bit IA5, so it does not contain the correct diacritical
marks for names that would normally use them.  No attempt has been made to
match surnames and given names culturally, so some unlikely combinations
will show up in the output!
